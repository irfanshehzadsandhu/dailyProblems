Rubymon
================

 Rubymon is a mobile app that allows players to catch, collect monsters, and eventually battle them. The game is played on a mobile app but we want to store user and monster information in the cloud. We need you to create a RESTful backend API to store and organize the monsters.

 Technical requirements:
 1. Ruby and PostgreSQL
